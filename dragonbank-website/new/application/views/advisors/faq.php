				You need 2 things to really make this successful.....focus and commitment. Start by deciding who you are targeting. Is it for existing clients' kids? Or are you targeting new relationships? School talks, girl guides, youth groups, church groups, sports teams, Montessori schools.....the list is endless. Once you decide that focus on where you are most comfortable.....get to it! Commit to handing out the dragon banks. If you are not comfortable visiting a school, you can just as easily start by handing out one bank to a family member or friend. Just ask that friend for a couple of other names and email addresses.....friends of that child and you are on your way.  It is easy once you start with a commitment to get it done. Your opportunities to help kids are everywhere!

				It is a great feeling to have earned those more stable relationships,  but there are 2 areas that are worth strengthening:<br><br>
				<ol> 
					<li>Wealth Transfer, and 2nd or 3rd generation relationship building: Building solid relationships deeper into your client families not only provides business development opportunities, but it protects you as your current clients look to start to transfer their wealth. By having relationships built with your client's children or grandchildren, you are preserving your client base as well as growing it.</li>
					<li>Hungry Competitors: In a competitive space like financial planning.....there are MANY advisors hungry to grow their businesses.....and they are looking to get clients from anywhere they can. Using this program to add more value to your client families is a key tactic in protecting your existing client base, making it much harder to have your clients poached.</li>

				The real key to success is all about <strong>ACTION</strong>. You have an innovative, helpful resource with this program that will help you connect with prospects and clients.....but the biggest step to success requires that you hand out the banks and ensure your prospect or clients gets it activated. Go speak to a classroom, speak to girl guides, sports team or youth groups. Invite parents to bring their kids to a meeting with you and give them this resource. Activate it while they are with you to ensure it gets done.
